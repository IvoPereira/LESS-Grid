# Customizing the Grid
The LESS grid is controlled by 3 variables located at the top of the document. Modifying these will produce practically any grid imaginable. Let's go through them one by one...

#### 1. @container-width
This variable controls the total width of grid. Common values for this are 900px, 960px, 1000px and 1080px, but virtually any pixel value should work. You could use 277px, 513px or even 937px &mdash; you get the picture. :)

#### 2. @columns-count
This variable controls the number of columns in your grid. You can enter any value from 2 - 16 here.

#### 2. @columns-margin
Changing the value of this column will give you whatever pixel value you want between your columns.
